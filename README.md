# Matcher

Example of pattern matching for my elixir talk 😅

This project uses a mix task called matcher for active development. Instead of using iex and having to rebuild state each time I copy the state into the mix task. If this does not make any sense just follow the install instructions. 🙂 

Hopefully I have some tests before the meetup. 😅

## Installation
```
git clone 
mix matcher
mix tests
```
